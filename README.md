## An opinionated system prompt for vibe coding val.town projects

The [opinionated-val-town.md](/tijs/opinionated-val-town/blob/main/opinionated-val-town.md) is a remixed and opinionated version of the LLM system prompt that [val town](https://val.town) offers:

[https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt](https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt)

You can drop this prompt in your CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md file, add your project specific notes and use it to let your LLM help you code your val.town web projects.
