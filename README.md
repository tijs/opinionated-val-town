# Opinionated valtown agent instructions

## An opinionated system prompt for vibe coding val.town projects

The [opinionated-val-town.md](https://github.com/tijs/opinionated-val-town/blob/main/opinionated-val-town.md) is a remixed and opinionated version of the LLM system prompt that [val town](https://val.town) offers:

[https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt](https://www.val.town/x/valdottown/Townie/code/prompts/system_prompt.txt)

You can drop this prompt in your CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md file, add your project specific notes and use it to let your LLM help you code your val.town web projects.

## When to use this

This system prompt makes sense if you are building val town projects locally, using Claude Code, Open Code or something similar. It also assumes you are using `vt`, the [command line tool for val town](https://github.com/val-town/vt) to push your code.
